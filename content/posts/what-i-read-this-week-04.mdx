I've always loved the idea of creating my own space on the internet. A _digital garden_ where I can share what I enjoy, keep notes on different programming topics, and experiment with new tools.

After playing with code for almost 3 years, I decided to transition into a technical role. I created this site to make it easy for potential employers to find my work. One of those leads came from Vercel, the company [I am now working for](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1410957812528816133).

Since this site has been so beneficial for me, I wanted to share an overview of how I built it — how I chose the stack, how I made design and content decisions, the resources I found helpful, and my future plans for it.

## Tech Stack

When choosing the stack, I made decisions based on three things:

- **Speed** - I needed to publish quickly and avoided tools with steep learning curves.
- **Experience** - I wanted to use what I personally enjoyed, because side projects should be fun.
- **Learning opportunities** - Once I got the basic information out there, I also wanted to experiment with new tools and use my site as a playground.

In the end, I settled for Next.js, MDX, Tailwind, Prisma and Typescript.

### Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React.js framework that handles the setup and requirements of building modern websites.

I personally enjoy using Next for a few reasons including:

- It’s flexible enough to handle my current and future content and data requirements.
- It helps with things that are normally tedious to set up such as [Webpack](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config), [Babel](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-babel-config), [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) and [ESLint](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint).
- It comes with in-built performance benefits such as code-splitting, [image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) and [script](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/script) optimizations, flexible options for [data fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching), and [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9).
- It offers a great developer experience with little to zero config such as [fast refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh#how-it-works).
