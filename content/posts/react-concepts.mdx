# React useReducer
-- **useReducer** has always been confusing for me, so I learned it in deapth from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgp_iCVS8ys).

First we have to think that **useReducer** is nothing but soluction to useState after it reaches it's limitations.

As your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see/mantain different components states and update it. As component grow so does t he state logic.
So to reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place we use **useReducer**.

We move state logi into a single function outside your component called a **reducer**.

we have this very interesting thought shift, instead of telling React "waht to do" which we did with useState, we specify "what the user just did", it completely changes the perspective.

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments: the current state and the action to be performed. It returns the new state.

```js
 interface Action {
  type: 'increment' | 'decrement';	 
 } 

 const initialState = 0;

 const reducer = (state, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
	 return state + 1;
      case 'decrement':
	  return state - 1;
      default:
	  return state;
   }
 }

 export const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = usereducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount('increment')}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount('decrement')}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
 }
```

# Next.js client client render.

Question: As stated by Next.js, component renders on the server. When it server to user/(You), you are seeing already pre-rendered page.?

But if that's true, how all this on the fly interaction is possible? **Ex: You click on a button and it changes the count**.

Answer: You can't do that. Next.js does not allow any interaction on the server-side. It's only for static page generation. But most interesting thing Next.js does on client side is called **hidration**, which is how we can interact with with this pre-rendered pages as well.

Yes, indeed even client components pre-rendered in server, which is good coz it help use faster page load etc. And pre-rendered means the static html files/structure.

**Then for interaction **React** performs process called **hydration**, During hydration, React attaches event listeners and state management to the static HTML, making it fully interactive.
