```md
Other ORMs and data frameworks tend to deviate/abstract you away from SQL, which leads to a double learning curve: needing to know both SQL and the frameworkâ€™s API.
```

Above is a statement that I read from [Drizzle ORM](https://drizzlekit.org/). Which I found very interesting and relevant.

So drizzle is ORM(Object Relational Mapping) for SQL. In more simple words, think of it like middleman between backend and database.
Helping you interact with the database using [TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) instead of raw SQL.

In drizzle **Queries done (using Drizzle-ORM) and migrations are done (using Drizzle-Kit).

# Third callback function in schema.

The third callback func in table declarations is used to define indexes and constraints for the table.

```ts
	const { pgTable, serial, text } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
	
	const users = pgTable('users', {
		id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
		name: text('name').notNull(),
		email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
		password: text('password').notNull(),
	},
		(users) => {
			return {
				emailIdx: uniqueIndex('email_idx').on(users.email),
			}
		}
	)
```
