# General deep dive into the LLM Model, AI technology that powers ChatGPT and related products.
  1. Finding raw data.
     - I my self used to wonder, how and where do they get all the data? There are generally two options:
       a. Crawl it yourself, like companies like ChatGPT does.
       b. You use a public repo of crawled webpages, like non-profit CommonCrawl.
       c. They are all this crawlers going around the internet. You start webpages and you follow all the links, and keep follwing the links and you keep indexing all the info. And endup having tons of data over time.
     - And this crowling goes through many many different way:

          width={1600}
          height={836}
        />
       a. this is first
       b. this is second
       c. this is third
       d. this is fourth
  2. this is number 2
