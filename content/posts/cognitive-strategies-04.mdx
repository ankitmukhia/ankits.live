## A cognitive strategy is a mental process or technique used to learn, solve problems, or process information effectively. It helps in thinking, remembering, and understanding concepts.

Examples of Cognitive Strategies:

1. **Chunking** – Breaking information into smaller parts to remember it easily.
2. **Repetition** – Repeating something multiple times to reinforce learning.
3. **Visualization** – Creating mental images to understand or recall information.
4. **Self-questioning** – Asking yourself questions to check understanding.
5. **Mnemonics** – Using memory aids like acronyms (e.g., GOAT for math gretness, making rhymes for learning words).
